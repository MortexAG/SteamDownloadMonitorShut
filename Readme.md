# SteamDownloadMonitorShut

SteamDownloadMonitorShut is a tailored application designed to keep an eye on your Steam downloads directory, offering the convenience of automatically shutting down your computer once all downloads are complete or specific criteria are met. It's built to save you time and energy, especially useful for managing large downloads or overnight updates.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Straightforward setup and easy to navigate.
- **Directory Monitoring Options**: Options to monitor only directories or all files within the specified path.
- **Auto Shutdown**: Triggers an automatic shutdown when the directory matches your predefined conditions, such as a certain number of remaining items.
- **Versatile Use**: Initially aimed at Steam users, but adaptable for monitoring any specified directory.

## Getting Started

1. **Setup**: Download The Release or Clone the repository to get started.
2. **Select Directory**: Launch the app and choose the Steam downloads directory or any other directory you wish to monitor.
3. **Define Shutdown Conditions**: Enter your criteria for automatic shutdown, like a specific number of remaining directories or files (Depends on The Version Of The App You Downloaded).
4. **Begin Monitoring**: Activate the monitoring with a click. You can halt the process at any time.

## How It Works

Leveraging `customtkinter` for a sleek interface, SteamDownloadMonitorShut periodically checks the designated directory for changes. Meeting the set conditions—like a specified number of items left—initiates your computer's shutdown process.

### For Everyone

Designed with simplicity in mind, SteamDownloadMonitorShut doesn't require programming knowledge. Follow the intuitive setup process, and let it manage the rest. It's perfect for ensuring your PC doesn't stay on unnecessarily after your downloads are complete, whether overnight or at any time.
